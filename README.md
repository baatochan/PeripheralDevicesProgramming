## Tasks done (from all that are available [here](http://www.zsk.ict.pwr.wroc.pl/zsk/dyd/intinz/up/lab/))
* Lab1 - Czytnik kart chipowych
* Lab2 - Obsługa joysticka USB z wykorzystaniem DirectInput
* Lab4 - Rejestracja sygnałów (Advantech DAQ)
* Lab5 - Bluetooth - komunikacja z telefonem komórkowym
* Lab6 - GPS

A lot of them is not finished/not working. A lot of them is not done by us as well.

Files that are under `\Lab#\original\*` are projects done by others found on the lab pc. Together those projects helped us pass this nightmare. I hope someone will find something from here useful.
